### Inspiration

The upcoming Olympic Games present one of a kind opportunity for Japan for showing the World the latest technology born inside it womb. One of these is humanoid robots, highly expected to arrive soon to a commercial state globally and regarded as one of Japan best products and qualities.

### What it does

In this project we develop a proof of concept applications for the humanoid robot Pepper, these consist on four different services provided by Pepper to both tourists and natives during the Tokyo Olympic Games that will be held in 2020. The applications are:

* Teaching about Japanese Culture (Praying at Shinto Shrines)
* Train station adviser
* Take a Photo and send by email
* Tourist information

### How we built it

The start of any project usually begins with a planning stage, this was not the exception. After carefully discuss the Ideas and Motivations of the team members, the theme for "Pepper 2020" was selected. <br>
The next step was selecting requirements for the system and the functionalities that would be provided. <br>
After a quick learning about Pepper hardware and software, the programming began, the methodology was held as shown next

* First Module: Body Movement.
* Second Module: Picture taking.
* Third Module: Email Sending.
* Fourth Module: Speech Recognition.
* Fifth Module: Tablet Usage.
* Sixth Module: Tourist Information.
* Seventh Module: Task Selection.
* Eightieth Module: Integration.
* Each of then include their proper testing stages.
